# personal-portfolio
Personal-Portfolio was made to check weather I can able to upload entire project into one shot or not.

But it happened due to further instruction provided by github itself.

Personal-portfolio is about my resume or CV information.

what I'm, where's belong to, my contacts, educations, skills, experiences, projects and awards, etc.

Technologies used in this project like Javascript, CSS and HTML.
